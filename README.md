## 🗃️ Database Design

### 👤 Users
- `id`
- `username`
- `email`
- `password`
- `is_host`

### 🏠 Properties
- `id`
- `title`
- `description`
- `location`
- `price_per_night`
- `owner_id` (FK to User)

### 📅 Bookings
- `id`
- `user_id` (FK to User)
- `property_id` (FK to Property)
- `start_date`
- `end_date`

### 💳 Payments
- `id`
- `booking_id` (FK to Booking)
- `amount`
- `payment_status`

### ✍️ Reviews
- `id`
- `user_id` (FK to User)
- `property_id` (FK to Property)
- `rating`
- `comment`

### 🔁 Relationships
- A **User** can own multiple **Properties**.
- A **User** can make multiple **Bookings**.
- A **Booking** belongs to one **Property**.
- A **Review** is linked to one **User** and one **Property**.
- A **Payment** is tied to a **Booking**.

## ✨ Feature Breakdown

### ✅ User Management
Handles registration, login, logout, and profile editing using secure authentication.

### 🏡 Property Management
Hosts can create, update, retrieve, and delete property listings.

### 📆 Booking System
Users can view availability, make bookings, and manage their reservations.

### 💰 Payment Processing
Secure handling of payments, transactions logged per booking.

### 🌟 Review System
Guests can rate and review properties post-booking to help others decide.

### ⚡ Data Optimization
Indexes and caching mechanisms are used to ensure performance and scalability.

## 🔐 API Security

### 🔑 Authentication
JWT-based or session-based auth for verifying users.

### 🔐 Authorization
Role-based access control (Host vs. User) to restrict certain actions.

### 🧱 Rate Limiting
Prevents abuse by limiting the number of requests per IP/user.

### 🔒 HTTPS
All traffic is encrypted using HTTPS to protect data in transit.

> 🛡️ **Why it matters:**  
- **User data** must be protected from unauthorized access.  
- **Payments** must be secure and verifiable.  
- **APIs** must be resilient to brute-force and DDoS attacks.

## 🔁 CI/CD Pipeline

### 📌 What is CI/CD?
Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) automate the testing and deployment of new code changes.

### 🧰 Tools Used
- **GitHub Actions**: Automates tests and linting on every push.
- **Docker**: Ensures consistent environments across development and production.
- **PostgreSQL Service**: Runs in Docker during test phase.
- **Heroku/Vercel/Render**: Optional deployment platforms.

> Benefits:
- Faster development cycles  
- Fewer bugs in production  
- Reliable deployments
